# FYP-BE
This API works with the front end React software in https://github.com/Jack-Curtis/FYP-FE.

This software directly communicates with the sensor devices and works as a bridge between the front-end software 
and the IMU sensor module.

The API provides various endpoints that the Front end software "hits". Once the endpoint is hit, the code is executed and a response is returned to the Front end software.

## Available Scripts

### npm install
Use this to initialise the project with all of the module dependencies

### npm run start
Use this to start the server and run the application
